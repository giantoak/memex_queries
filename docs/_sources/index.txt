Welcome to memex_queries's documentation!
=========================================

``memex_queries`` helps write high-level Python queries for accessing MEMEX
data collected and generated by the different teams. It is primarily focused
on escort ad data.

* The ``memex_queries.helpers`` subpackage  works directly with interfaces for
  `HBase`_, `Elasticsearch`_, `SQLite`_, and -eventually- other data stores used
  by MEMEX teams to make them easy to query.
* The top-level ``memex_queries`` module provides a home for python functions
  written by the different teams that use the ``helpers`` to integrate multiple
  general queries for specific results. Essentially, they allow teams to share
  their work by using a common pipeline.
