Welcome to memex_queries's documentation!
=========================================

``memex_queries`` is a collection of Python functions for accessing MEMEX
data collected and generated by the different teams. It is primarily focused
on escort ad data.

* The ``memex_queries.helpers`` subpackage  works with resources
  developed by the different teams, either stored in private data stores
  or on the MEMEX Cluster. (The Cluster is currently maintained by Data
  Machines.) These resources are in a variety of formats, including
  `HBase`_, `Elasticsearch`_, and `SQLite`_.) Each team has a dedicated
  sub-sub-package, in which queries against their specific resources are
  collated. Modules in ``helpers`` wrap queries that need to cut across
  multiple resources.

* The top-level ``memex_queries`` module provides a home for python functions
  written by the different teams that use the ``helpers`` to integrate multiple
  general queries for specific results. Essentially, they allow teams to share
  their work that everyone can read.
